## Getting Started :airplane:

## Configuration üìÅ

TODO table with options and explanation
TODO Gotcha with commit access

TODO Do I need to keep the required/optional sections below ?


TODO: Change wording: the `only_people_` flag will refer to the user who is responsible for triggering the workflow (the actor in GH Actions terminology).
If that user is including changes from other people, this actions will not know
about it. Code Reviews helps mitigate this issue.

```yaml
jobs:
  job_name:
    steps:
      - uses: fmonniot/actions-deny-execution@v1
        with:
            # Fail execution if someone not mentionned modified a file
            # within the path.
            # For PR: will look at the entire branch diff
            # For tag: will look at the diff with the previous tag
            # For commit: will look at the commit only.
            # The laste one means that someone with write access to a branch
            # can change one the file within `path` in a unit (PR/tag/commit)
            # and then create a second unit outside of `path` to use the
            # previous modification. Grants permission carefully.
          restricted_path: .github
          only_people: |
           fmonniot
           someone
      # If you need to restrict additional paths, you'll have to use multiple
      # steps. GitHub Actions does not support arrays in its inputs.
      # TODO Multiline restricted_paths ?
      - uses: fmonniot/actions-deny-execution@v1
        with:
          restricted_path: dist
          only_people: fmonniot
```

TODO Investigate alternate syntax and features:
```yml
jobs:
  job_name:
    steps:
      - uses: fmonniot/actions-deny-execution@v1
        with:
          codeowners: .github/codeowners.md
          # warn if path/people is also defined, saying owners have priority
      - uses: fmonniot/actions-deny-execution@v1
        with:
          restricted_path: .github
          only_people: |
           fmonniot
           someone
```

On GHE 3.1, env can be protected by reviewer and wait time. On github.com, branches can also be used to restrict execution.
